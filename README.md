# SQL-Challenge
For this task, we crafted an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and table schemas to portray the data in the data modeling stage. In the course of the data engineering process, the table schemas underwent translation into database structures. Ultimately, we conducted a thorough analysis of the data to derive valuable insights regarding employees, departments, and their interconnections.
